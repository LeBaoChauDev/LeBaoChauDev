## Tell Me a Little Bit About Yourself :sunglasses:

I have been learning front-end web development for more than two years. I specialized in creating accessible websites. In the last year alone, I have completed more than 20 projects in Frontend Mentor. I also helped hundreds of people in the Frontend Mentor community by critically analyzing their code and giving them feedback.

My strength is my ability to create accessible websites. I pride myself on my reputation in the community by creating responsive and accessible websites. Not only that, every time I have done creating the website, I spare my time to write `README` to explain the process of how I created the website.

**I recommend looking through the pinned repositories which showcase my current skills.**

I spend my free time playing [sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku). :wink:
